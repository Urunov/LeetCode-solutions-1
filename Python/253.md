Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:

```
Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1
```

## Solution 1 (time O(n), space O(n))

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals):
        """
        :type intervals: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(intervals) == 0:
            return 0
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        rooms = []
        heapq.heappush(rooms, intervals[0][1])
        for i in intervals[1:]:
            if rooms[0] <= i[0]:
                heapq.heappop(rooms)
            heapq.heappush(rooms, i[1])
        return len(rooms)
```
