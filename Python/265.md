# 265. Paint House II

There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

```
Input: [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
Â             Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5. 
```

Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?

## Solution 1 (time O(nk), space O(nk))

```python
# Dynamic programming
class Solution(object):
    def minCostII(self, costs):
        """
        :type costs: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(costs) == 0 or len(costs[0]) == 0:
            return 0
        n, k = len(costs), len(costs[0])
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(k)] for _ in range(n)]
        prev_min = float("inf")
        prev_min_index = -1
        prev_second_min = float("inf")
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(k):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = costs[i][j]
                elif j == prev_min_index:
                    dp[i][j] = prev_second_min + costs[i][j]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = prev_min + costs[i][j]
            prev_min = float("inf")
            prev_min_index = -1
            prev_second_min = float("inf")
            for j in range(k):
                if dp[i][j] < prev_min:
                    prev_second_min = prev_min
                    prev_min = dp[i][j]
                    prev_min_index = j
                elif dp[i][j] < prev_second_min:
                    prev_second_min = dp[i][j]
        return min(dp[-1])
